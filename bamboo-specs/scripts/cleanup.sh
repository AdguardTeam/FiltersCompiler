# 'set' should be added to the beginning of each script to ensure that it runs with the correct options.

# cannot change the options of B script.
# -e: Exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status (i.e., if a command fails).
# -x: Print each command to the terminal as it is executed, which is useful for debugging.
